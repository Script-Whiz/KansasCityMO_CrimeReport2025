Your Rideshare Bodyguard!

### **Identifying High-Risk Areas for Rideshare Safety in KC** 
**Objective:** Help VendiSafe create a data-driven approach to identifying **high-risk locations in Kansas City** where drivers and passengers may need extra safety measures. 

**Steps:** 
1. **Collect Data:** Gather publicly available crime data, accident reports, and rideshare-related incident data for **Kansas City.** 

2. **Clean & Organize Data:** Remove duplicates, fix missing values, and structure the data for analysis. 

3. **Explore Patterns:** Analyze trendsâ€”are there certain times or locations in KC with more safety incidents? 

4. **Visualize Insights:** Create **heatmaps and dashboards** showing "hotspots" for safety concerns in Kansas City. 

5. **Predict Risks:** Use machine learning models to predict when and where the next safety risks might occur in KC. 

6. **Actionable Report:** Provide a summary of findings with recommendations on how VendiSafe can implement safety measures (e.g., alerting drivers in high-risk areas).

This would directly support our **"Your Rideshare Bodyguard"** mission by making rideshare experiences **smarter and safer** for both drivers and passengers in Kansas City.
